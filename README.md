MEAN stack based CMS designed specifically for developers. 
microCMS allows a developer to build a fast, poweful website without the limits
of a conventional CMS, no longer needing to worry with the "one size fits all"
solutions, each site can be tailored specifically to a projeject while still
allowing the client to be able to safely edit the sites content without running
the risk of them breaking the site in the process.
